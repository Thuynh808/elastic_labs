## Project Overview
The elastic_labs project is designed to simulate a Elastic Stack environment using Ansible for automated deployment and management. This setup focuses on configuring a comprehensive SIEM system that includes Elasticsearch, Kibana, Zeek integration, and Elastic Agents on a controlled RHEL environment.

### Objectives
- Automate majority of the setup using Ansible, from system configuration to application deployment
- Integrate Elasticsearch and Kibana for data indexing and visualization
- Deploy Zeek on selected nodes to monitor network traffic and log activities
- Manage Elastic Agents on RHEL and Windows VMs for endpoint security and log collection
- Create and enforce policies through Fleet management in Kibana, enhancing the real-time security posture
- Create dashboards and rules for testing
- Generate log telemetry and trigger alerts for analysis

### Architecture
- **Control Node:** Hosts Elasticsearch and Kibana orchestrating the SIEM framework
- **Node1:** Setup as Fleet Server to manage agent policies in a centralized environment
- **Node1 and Node2:** Run Zeek for network monitoring and Elastic Agents for endpoint security
- **Node3-Windows:** Extends the monitoring to include Windows-specific threats using Sysmon and Windows Defender integrations

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure the following are prepared:
- 3 RHEL 8 VMs
- 1 Windows 10 VM

| Server           | Role               | CPU | RAM  |
|------------------|--------------------|-----|------|
| Control(rhel 8)  | Management         | 4   | 8 GB |
| Node1(rhel 8)    | Fleet/Zeek         | 2   | 4 GB |     
| Node2(rhel 8)    | Elastic Agent/zeek | 2   | 2 GB |    
| Node3(windows 10)| Elastic Agent      | 4   | 8 GB |  

- **Network Configuration**: Set IP addresses and hostnames for each VM. Networking mode is set to NAT Network with port forwarding configured to allow access from host.

> **Note:** Throughout this project, root password set to *'password'*

## Setup Environment
- **Insert the RHEL ISO on control node**
  
- **Run the command to mount the ISO**
  
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt
  ```

  ```bash
  dnf config-manager --add-repo=file:///mnt/AppStream
  dnf config-manager --add-repo=file:///mnt/BaseOS
  echo "gpgcheck=0" >> /etc/yum.repos.d/mnt_AppStream.repo
  echo "gpgcheck=0" >> /etc/yum.repos.d/mnt_BaseOS.repo
  ```
- **Install `git` and `ansible-core`**
  
  ```bash
  dnf install -y git ansible-core
  ```
- **Clone the repository**
  
  ```bash

## Conclusion
What an incredibly rewarding journey! From deep diving into documentations to troubleshooting agent policies, I learned a lot along the way. Automating the Elastic Stack deployment with Ansible made the setup smoother and reduced errors. Compiling Zeek for RHEL was challenging but proved how powerful open-source tools can be. The testing phase allowed me to simulate security incidents and fine-tune our system's response. Overall, this project sharpened my automation and security analysis skills, getting me ready for real-world challenges.
